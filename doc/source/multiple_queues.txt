 Managing multiple queues

Simple queues allowing pushing, popping, and sequential traversal
=================================================================

Code: `<schema/multiple_queues_001.py>`__
`(colorized) <schema/multiple_queues_001.py-colorized>`__

In this recipe, we discuss a simple queue structure that exhibits the
following traits:

- Items can be pushed onto a queue.

- Items can be popped from a queue.

- Queues can be traversed sequentially.

- An item can be in more than one queue.

- An item can only appear once in a given queue.

Use version 1 of this recipe's schema:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> from schevo.test import DocTestEvolve
    >>> t = DocTestEvolve('schevocookbook.multiple_queues.schema', 1)

For convenience, use the `by` method of the `Item` and `Queue` extents
to populate local variables from sample data.  This works because of
the keys specified for those extents (lines 9, 30).  Keys act as
unique indices.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6 = t.db.Item.by('number')
    >>> q1, q2 = t.db.Queue.by('name')

Initially, each queue is empty.  The `size` field is a calculated
field (lines 26-28).  That is, the size is not stored as a field
value, but rather calculated on-the-fly using data maintained
elsewhere in the database.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> q1.size
    0
    >>> q2.size
    0

Push items `i1`, `i2`, and `i3` onto queue `q1` as separate
transactions.  See the `push` transaction method (lines 37-41) and the
`E.Queue._Push` transaction class (lines 67-92) for how these work.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> print t.db.execute(q1.t.push(item=i1))
    A :: 1
    >>> print t.db.execute(q1.t.push(item=i2))
    A :: 2
    >>> print t.db.execute(q1.t.push(item=i3))
    A :: 3

Push items `i2`, `i3`, and `i4` onto queue `q2` as an atomic
transaction.  This makes use of the `Combination` transaction built
into Schevo, which allows multiple unrelated transactions to be
executed atomically:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> from schevo.transaction import Combination
    >>> transactions = [
    ...     q2.t.push(item=i2),
    ...     q2.t.push(item=i3),
    ...     q2.t.push(item=i4),
    ...     ]
    >>> results = t.db.execute(Combination(transactions))
    >>> for r in results:
    ...     print r
    B :: 2
    B :: 3
    B :: 4

Each queue now has three members:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> q1.size
    3
    >>> q2.size
    3

Non-destructively inspect the queue in bidirectional order from either
end by starting at the `head` or `tail` field value of a queue,
traversing with the `next` and `previous` fields, and finally by
retrieving the queue member's `item` and that item's `number`.

`previous` is a calculated field that makes use of Schevo's automatic
bidirectional entity linking (lines 105-111).

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> q1.head.item.number
    1
    >>> q1.head.next.item.number
    2
    >>> q1.head.next.next.item.number
    3
    >>> q1.head.next.next.next
    UNASSIGNED
    >>> q1.head.next.next.previous.item.number
    2

    >>> q1.tail.item.number
    3
    >>> q1.tail.previous.item.number
    2

Destructively pop the first item available at the head of each
queue. See the `pop` transaction method (lines 32-35) and the
`E.Queue._Pop` transaction class (lines 43-65) for how these work.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> item = t.db.execute(q1.t.pop())
    >>> item == i1
    True
    >>> q1.size
    2
    >>> q1.head.item.number
    2

    >>> item = t.db.execute(q2.t.pop())
    >>> item == i2
    True
    >>> q2.size
    2
    >>> q2.head.item.number
    3

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, "an item can only
appear once in a given queue."  Attempt to add an item to a queue that
is already in the queue and Schevo raises a `KeyCollision` exception.
This is due to the key specified for the `QueueMember` extent (line
113):

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> t.db.execute(q2.t.push(item=i3))    #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    KeyCollision: ("Duplicate value ... for key ('queue', 'item') ...)

    >>> t.done()
